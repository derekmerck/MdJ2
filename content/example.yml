Short Background
=================

About {{ data.key1 }} days ago, I joined the circus, and have never looked back.

Method
=================

If you want to cite something from your Zotero library, export it to your home directory as "MyLibrary.yaml", then use Pandoc style citations.

`[@Keshavamurthy_SPIE_2017]`

Renders as [@Keshavamurthy_SPIE_2017]

Force inline bibliography entries (at the place of citation) by adding `[s]uppress-bibliography: True` in the pandoc parsable metadata.

You can use Jinja2 markup inline, so `{{ data.key1 * data.key2 }}` will become {{ data.key1 * data.key2 }}.

Tables
-----------------

If you are using a csv table, you should pre-load it by calling it "budget" or "table".  Then you can reference it by name.

{% include "table.csv" %}

Mermaid
-----------------

Mermaid can be included with the common embedded code format:

```
\`\`\`mermaid
{% include "timeline.mmd" %}
\`\`\`
```

```mermaid
{% include "timeline.mmd" %}
```
